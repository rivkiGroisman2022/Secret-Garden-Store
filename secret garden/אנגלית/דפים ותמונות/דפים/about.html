        <h3>Why do you need garden furniture?</h3>
        <p id="con">
        
            You designed a garden, you added lighting, but without landscaped garden furniture, something is still missing. The professional team of secret garden explains why
            You should invest and add designed and quality garden furniture to your garden.
        </p>
        <h3>What is garden furniture?</h3>
        <p id="con">
        
        If furniture is a category that includes various objects that are used for sitting, eating and other functions inside the house, then garden furniture is a nickname for furniture that is placed in the garden. In the past, garden furniture amounted to white plastic chairs and a table that had difficulty standing on its feet and flew in all winds.
        Is common, however, in recent years there has been a boom in the field, and garden furniture has become thoughtful and meaningful. International exhibitions dedicated to garden furniture,
        Designers are turning to the field and today you can also find luxury brands that produce furniture that is aimed at standing in your backyard.
        </p>
        <h3>Why should you invest in landscaped garden furniture?</h3>
        <p id="con">
        
            Garden furniture is a functional means that will allow you to sit in the garden comfortably, but it also provides your garden with added value. Designer furniture
            Will give the garden a unique look, and by matching the various furniture items, and between them and the design of the garden you can create space
            Specially designed and inviting.
        </p>
        <h3>Invest in quality furniture</h3>
        <p id="con"> 
        
            The biggest mistake you can make in the context of garden furniture is to choose the furniture without thinking about the materials from which it is made and
            Its durability. No matter how beautiful the chairs you choose, and how aesthetically pleasing the table, if you do not choose quality and durable furniture everything will be ruined inside
           Season or two. In summer the sun beats down on the furniture, and in winter the wind and rain beat them mercilessly. Even if you make sure to cover them, and even
            Store them on rainy days, if the furniture is made of the wrong materials they are simply God forbid.

        <h3>Where to buy garden furniture? - Furniture for a sun terrace is bought only in the secret garden</h3>
        <p id="con">
            You are interested in purchasing garden furniture
            High quality and designed, but you have no idea where to buy. You can go to various stores that specialize in garden furniture, but you are not
           Must leave the house to buy quality furniture, you will find excellent stores that sell quality furniture at an affordable price. Pay attention
          For the materials from which the furniture you order is made, as well as the warranty that the store provides for its products. Eventually you will be able to order furniture
          At an affordable price that will reach your home. We invite you to be impressed by the variety of garden furniture in our catalog and choose the right furniture for you.</p>
        <p id="con">One of the most common questions that arises when talking about garden furniture, is "Why do we even need it? Does garden furniture have to
            Be dedicated furniture for this? What's wrong with taking two or three chairs out of the house itself, a small table, and that's it? "So that's it, no. Furniture
             Located outside, exposed to rain, sun, wind and other injuries, must contain certain features, without which, it may
             Will be able to function as "furniture", but his life will be short and his wear and tear will be much greater, from the wear and tear applied to furniture intended for residence
             In the yard, in the garden or in the garden. This is why there are stores that specialize in garden furniture, like a secret garden, for example, and not every chair
            Or a table out of the house would suit that.</p>
            <h3>What, in fact, garden furniture should deal with?</h3>
        <p id="con">
            We mentioned earlier the forces of nature, and therefore, we will now expand a little on the subject of wear and tear that they are
            May cause furniture that is not suitable for continuous stay outside the walls of the house. Water, for example, whether it originates in the sky or whether it originates
             In the irrigation faucet, it can cause corrosion in furniture made of metal that is not resistant to it. They can also cause rot of
            Materials such as rattan, straw, wood, sponge and fabrics, which have not undergone the appropriate treatment that protects them from water penetration, accumulation or absorption. If
            You thought that only winter could damage the garden furniture, you were wrong, because too much heat or the blazing sun directly on the furniture has a significant part
            In their wear and loss of aesthetic appearance.</p>
